# This is my Javascript - Fundamentals & Data Types Project.

## I worked this assignment as i was trying to teach myself the fundamentals of Javascript.
## I did column by column and i was trying to have good explanation with good comments of what i was doing.

## I feel like doing this assignment this way would help me understand the concepts better and also others who would go over it.
